ArduinoCourse.pptx contains my lecture slides for the Introduction and the Arduino 101 segments of the course.

The Arduino 101 folder contains the sketches that will be used (in the Sketches folder) and the lesson pdfs that I expect will be used at the top level.  More detail, including schematics, can be found in each subfolder.  My hope is that the students will not need to go into each lesson folder during Arduino 101, since I think this may cause confusion and will certainly eat up time.  So, I may incorporate the schematics into my Arduino 101 slides.

The Projects folder contains the latest and greatest documentation (and code, schematics, etc) that I was able to obtain for each project.  Please look through the folder for your project and bring any updates to class in a form that all students can get them (note: instructor-provided laptops can't access to APLNIS, but can get on the guest network).

The Arduino IDE folder contains copies of the install files for different OS.  No different from what can be obtained off arduino.cc.
